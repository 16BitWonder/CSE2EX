# Cave Story Engine 2
I'm rewriting Cave Story Engine from scratch, to be more accurate than before!

Cave Story Engine is a recompilation of Cave Story (freeware release), also porting it from DirectX to SDL2

How to build:

Create "build" directory

cd to the base directory,

make (RELEASE=1 for release build)



JAPANESE=1 to enable certain Japanese differences

FIX_BUGS=1 to fix certain bugs (see src/Bug Fixes.txt)
